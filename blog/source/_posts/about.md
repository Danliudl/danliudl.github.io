Hi, I'm Dan, a girl with 2 cats ^._.^

I love designs as well as the whole design process, it is interesting and could be quite satisfying to start from sketch and then create something that solves a problem. I believe good design can add values to people and have the power to make a difference to life. 

Currently, I am in the second year of masterâ€™s study in Human-Computer Interaction and Design in Aalto University, and now actively looking for an Internship, a Master's Thesis opportunity or a Full-time position as a UX/UI designer. 

I am a quick learner and eager to get more practical experience as a UX/UI designer with passion and enthusiasm! Please contact me if you would like to work or speak with me! Thank you very much!
