## The Non-Designer's Design Book
*Robin Williams / Design and Typographic Principles for the Visual Novice / Third Edition* 

### Design Principles
4 basic design principles: 

**Proximity / Alignment / Repetition / Contrast**

---

**Proximity**
Proximity implies a relationship: where to begin and when to finish.

*Where to begin reading? Where to read next?*

<img src="02.png" width="49%"/> 
</br>*This one communicates more clearly*

<span style="border-bottom:2px solid yellow;">Summary:</span>
Grouping based on Logical Connection. Where to stark looking? Where to end up? Where does the eye go next?

**Alignment**
- nothing should be placed arbitrarily
- every item should have a visual connection

</br>Lift or right-aligned text has a stronger visual connection -- Strength of the layout

<span style="border-bottom:2px solid yellow;">Summary:</span>
- Check every element to make sure it has a visual connection to something else on the page.

<img src="06.png" width="49%"/>

- Find a strong line (e.g. photo) and use it for alignment

**Repetition**
Strong repetitive elements imply consistency, unifying design pieces visually:

*The eye goes between the bold texts--it ties design piece together*

**Contrast**
<img src="c1.jpg" width="30%" height="300px"/> &emsp; <img src="c2.jpg" width="30%" height="300px"/> &emsp; <img src="c3.jpg" width="30%" height="300px"/>

With contrast, the entire table is stronger and easy to know where it begins and where it ends.
* create an interest/a focus on the page;
* imply the logic flow;
* with strength.

### Using Colour
**CMYK**: Cyan (which is a blue), Magenta (which is sort of red/pink), Yellow, and a Key color, which is usually black  
**RGB**: RGB stands for Red, Green, and Blue. rgb is what you see on your computer monitor, television, iPhone, etc. 

Use CMYK for projects that are to be printed. Use RGB for anything that will be viewed on a screen.
RGB makes smaller file sizes, and switching back and forth from cmyk to rgb loses a little data each time.
